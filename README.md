# Dephasing-Measure
A code for experimental control to read the coherence of a single ion (qubit) locally interacting with ion chain.

Briefly, the goal of the experimental sequence (the code) is to measure the coherence of an ion/qubit interacting with a chain of ions via exchanged bosons where the bosonic states are motional states or travelling phonons across the ions chain. Ramsey measurements is implemented and executed at each data point with different phases (four angles on the Block sphere in this case) while rapidly varying the gap time between the two Ramsey pulses.

Acknowledgement: Most of the libraries in the code (commented as '#Joint efforts') have been created by several colleagues of mine, undergraduate and graduate students at UC Berkeley.
